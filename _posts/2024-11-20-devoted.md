Interior pages of 'Devoted'

*Devoted*  
October 2024

In 2024 I self published a 16 page mini graphic novel titled 'Devoted.' The story is a Victorian fantasy romance featuring lavish interiors, political intrigue, and shameless flirting.

The comic is entirely black and white with screentones for shading. It was drawn digitally with Clip Studio Paint, and laid out in InDesign. The comic premeired in October at Chicago Alternative Comics Expo (CAKE) and Zinecinnati in Cincinnati, OH; I gave a reading of the first few pages at Indie Northern Kentucky as a part of the lead up to Zinecinnati.
