Specialty Latte Menu and Flavor Menu for Villa Mocha, a local coffee shop.

I designed a specialty menu with both customer and business in mind. The smaller hand held menu makes it easier for customers to comfortably view and select their favorite latte, and also highlights the specialty items for the coffee shop. Simple typography, inviting copy, and a minimalist art deco inspired design come together to make an ideal menu for Villa Mocha.
