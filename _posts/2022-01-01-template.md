Post content goes here.

Name of the file should be be formatted: YYYY-MM-DD-title.md with the date being the date posted and not the date drafted.

Posts can be written in markdown (https://github.github.com/gfm/) or html.

Links are written like this `[link text](link address)`

And images like this `![alt text](image address)`

`<!--more-->` is how you create an excerpt for your post. the text above `<!--more-->` will show on your blog's main page, and the text below will only show when viewing the post itself. This is great if you have long posts, or want to include process images of your work but don't necessarily want them on the front page.
