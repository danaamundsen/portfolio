# Links

<!-- Linking your website to others is good practice on the Open Web. It allows others to find new artists organically. Think of it like you're curating a library of your favorite websites to share with your visitors. I've started your links page by providing a link to my own artist website, but feel free to link whomever you'd like! -->
